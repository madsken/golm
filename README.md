# 🧮 GOLM — Go Linear Math Library

> **Work in Progress** — This project is an experimental port of the [GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) library to Go.
> GOLM aims to bring familiar vector, matrix, and quaternion math utilities to the Go ecosystem.

---

## 🚧 Status

GOLM is currently **under heavy development**.
APIs, naming conventions, and package structures are subject to change at any time.

---

## 📦 Goals

* Mirror GLM’s API style where it makes sense in Go
* Provide idiomatic Go naming and design
* Be dependency-free and efficient for use in graphics, simulation, and game engines

---

## 🧱 Example (Coming Soon)

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

1. Implement all vector types (`vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`)
2. Add matrix support (`mat2`, `mat3`, `mat4`)
3. Implement quaternions (`quat`)
4. Add math utilities (projection, rotation, transformation)
5. Benchmark and optimize
